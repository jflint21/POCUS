# Introduction to Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS)

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

<img src="images/Butterfly_Probe.jpg" alt="Butterfly probes are a common tool for POCUS studies."  />
<p class="caption">
Butterfly probes are a common tool for POCUS studies.
</p>

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="README_files/figure-markdown_strict/pressure-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
