# Introduction to Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS)

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r ssa-logo, fig.cap = "Butterfly probes are a common tool for POCUS studies."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "Butterfly_Probe.jpg"))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
